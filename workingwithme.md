## Working With Me

### Conditions I like to work in

- I like the right place for the different types of work. Open spaces for connecting and collaborating with other people, quiet places for focus work. I often go to a coffee shop, conference room, or work from home when I need to focus. I also often wear headphones listening to white noise or wordless music when I’m focusing. I also appreciate diversity of work - having a balance of collaborating, learning, doing, and recharging. Too much of any one thing zaps my energy.

### The ways I like to receive feedback

- I love feedback, finding new options to learn / grow and learn about new options so that I can be of better service to myself and others. Feedback can be hard to receive, but it's such a service to give it to someone. I sometimes need some time to process it (ex. give me a day or two).

- I appreciate candid and direct communication. I prefer receiving feedback face to face so we can have a conversation about it.

- I appreciate timely feedback so that it’s actionable and easier to digest vs a large batch of feedback.

- I appreciate frequent feedback. Incremental feedback is often easier to process.

### Things I need

- I need to deeply understand the why behind something before I do it.

- I need time to recharge my energy so I can focus on activities that require a lot of energy and attention.

- I need other people in my live. I'm always interested in connecting with new people to learn how we can potentially serve each other - as collaborators, as co-creators, as humans, etc.

- I need to balance consuming with making. I need to balance being with other people with being with myself. I generally need balance.

### How I learn best

- I’m a visual learner. I like drawing, pictures, and videos.

- I learn through real tactical examples and stories. I like to dive into a topic deeply at least once to really understand it.

- I learn by doing and through experience. I believe learning is an iterative experiential process, so I prefer minimal planning before doing. When I'm not sure what to do, I do something.

### Things I struggle with

- Too many processes or activities that aren’t connected with a why or aren’t producing value. Anything that isn't directly achieving a goal is waste and should only occur if it's serving the outcome.

- Too much top-down management or control; if prefer autonomy with clear goals and guardrails.

- Too much "thinking about it" or "thinking through it" doesn't work for me. Some structure and thought is helpful, but learning by doing and co-creating with other people (especially the people I'm trying to serve) works best for me.
