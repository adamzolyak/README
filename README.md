## My Principles

### Bias to Action

Learn by doing, iterating, and achieve small incremental wins along the way; don’t wait for perfect answers before taking action, have strong opinions loosely held. Often, the only way out is through!

### Be Intentional

Have a vision. Say yes to the most interesting things and no or "maybe later" to the rest. Be transparent and candid with other people so that your intentions are clear, and create shared objectives and working agreements.

### Diverge and Experiment

Seek multiple diverse and divergent points of view. Form multiple hypotheses. Try multiple options and experiments. Co-create and collaborate with other people. Put yourself in situations where you bump into new ideas.

### Be Curious

Lead through asking questions and starting with an egoless beginner's mindset to learn how to best serve. Be willing to fail and find value in the learning therein.

### Be Present

Be present with other people and with myself through active listening, active feeling, active being - especially asking clarifying questions and being slow and thoughtful before responding and making space for other people.

### Be of Service to Others

Connect with people to understand who they are, serving them and co-creating with them. Treat everyone as they truly are - whole, capable, awesome!

### Be Authentic and Vulnerable

Dare to bring the whole me to being and doing do, and dare to deeply connect with other people even if that sometimes means having difficult conversations or things getting weird. There is tremendous possibility for joy (as well as tribulation) in being authentic and vulnerable!

### Play

Keep it light; smile, joke, play! It's an important part of being a human and connecting with other people. And it's a heck of a lot of fun!

## Working With Me

### Conditions I like to work in

- I like the right place for the different types of work. Open spaces for connecting and collaborating with other people, quiet places for focus work. I often go to a coffee shop, conference room, or work from home when I need to focus. I also often wear headphones listening to white noise or wordless music when I’m focusing. I also appreciate diversity of work - having a balance of collaborating, learning, doing, and recharging. Too much of any one thing zaps my energy.

### The ways I like to receive feedback

- I love feedback, finding new options to learn / grow and learn about new options so that I can be of better service to myself and others. Feedback can be hard to receive, but it's such a service to give it to someone. I sometimes need some time to process it (ex. give me a day or two).

- I appreciate candid and direct communication. I prefer receiving feedback face to face so we can have a conversation about it.

- I appreciate timely feedback so that it’s actionable and easier to digest vs a large batch of feedback.

- I appreciate frequent feedback. Incremental feedback is often easier to process.

### Things I need

- I need to deeply understand the why behind something before I do it.

- I need time to recharge my energy so I can focus on activities that require a lot of energy and attention.

- I need other people in my live. I'm always interested in connecting with new people to learn how we can potentially serve each other - as collaborators, as co-creators, as humans, etc.

- I need to balance consuming with making. I need to balance being with other people with being with myself. I generally need balance.

### How I learn best

- I’m a visual learner. I like drawing, pictures, and videos.

- I learn through real tactical examples and stories. I like to dive into a topic deeply at least once to really understand it.

- I learn by doing and through experience. I believe learning is an iterative experiential process, so I prefer minimal planning before doing. When I'm not sure what to do, I do something.

### Things I struggle with

- Too many processes or activities that aren’t connected with a why or aren’t producing value. Anything that isn't directly achieving a goal is waste and should only occur if it's serving the outcome.

- Too much top-down management or control; if prefer autonomy with clear goals and guardrails.

- Too much "thinking about it" or "thinking through it" doesn't work for me. Some structure and thought is helpful, but learning by doing and co-creating with other people (especially the people I'm trying to serve) works best for me.
