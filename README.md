## My Principles

### Bias to Action
Learn by doing, iterating, and achieve small incremental wins along the way; donâ€™t wait for perfect answers before taking action, have strong opinions loosley held.

### Be Intentional
Know your objectives and key results.  Say yes to the most valuable things and no or "maybe later" to the rest.  Be transparent and candid with other people so that your intentions are clear, and create shared objective and working agreements.

### Diverge and Experiment 
Seek multiple diverse and divergent points of view.  Form multiple hypothesises.  Identify multiple options and experiment.  Co-create and collaborate with other people.  

### Be Curious
Lead through asking questions and starting with an egoless mindset to learn how to best serve.  Be willing to fail and find value in the learning therein.

### Be Present
Be present with other people and with me through active listening, active feeling, active being - especially being slow and thoughtful before responding and making space for other people.

### Be of Service to Others
Connect with people to understand who they are, serving them and co-creating with them.  Treat everyone as they truely are - whole and capable.

### Be Authentic and Vulnerable
Dare to bring the whole me to being and doing do, and dare to deeply connect with other people even if that sometimes means having difficult conversations or things getting weird.  There is tremendous possbility for joy (as well as tribulation) in being authentic and vulnerable! 

### Play
Keep it light; smile, joke, play!  It's an important part of being a human and connecting with other people.

## My Type

I am an [Enneagram Type 7 with an 8 Wing](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-7) and an INTJ.

## Working With Me

### Conditions I like to work in

* I like the right place for the right type of work.  Open spaces for connecting and collaborating with other people, quiet places for focus work.  I often go to a coffee shop, conference room, or work from home when I need to focus.  I also often wear headphones listening to white noise or wordless music when Iâ€™m focusing.  

### The ways I like to receive feedback

* I love learning about feedback and new options to help improve myself so that I can be of better service to myself and others.  Feedback can be hard to receive, but it's such a service to give it to someone.

* I appreciate candid and direct communication.  I prefer receiving feedback face to face so we can have a conversation about it.

* I appreciate timely feedback so that itâ€™s actionable and easier to digest vs a large batch of feedback.

* I appreciate frequent feedback.  

### Things I need

* I need to deeply understand the why behind something before I do it.

* I need time to recharge my energy so I can focus on activities that require a lot of energy and attention.

* I need other people in my live.  I'm always interested in connecting with new people to learn how we can potentially serve each other - as collaborators, as co-creators, as humans, etc.  

### How I learn best

* Iâ€™m a visual learner. I like drawing, pictures, and videos.

* I learn through real tactical examples and stories.  I like to live deep at least once.

* I learn by doing and through experience.  I believe learning is an iterative experiential process, so I prefer minimal planning before doing. 

### Things I struggle with

* Too many processes or activities that arenâ€™t connected with a why or arenâ€™t producing value.  Anything that isn't directly achieving a goal is waste and should only occur if it's serving the outcome.

* Too much top-down management or control; if prefer autonomy with clear goals and guardrails.
