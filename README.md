## My Principles

### Bias to Action

Learn by doing, iterating, and achieve small incremental wins along the way; donâ€™t wait for perfect answers before taking action, have strong opinions loosely held. Often, the only way out is through!

### Be Intentional

Have a vision. Say yes to the most interesting things and no or "maybe later" to the rest. Be transparent and candid with other people so that your intentions are clear, and create shared objectives and working agreements.

### Diverge and Experiment

Seek multiple diverse and divergent points of view. Form multiple hypotheses. Try multiple options and experiments. Co-create and collaborate with other people. Put yourself in situations where you bump into new ideas.

### Be Curious

Lead through asking questions and starting with an egoless beginner's mindset to learn how to best serve. Be willing to fail and find value in the learning therein.

### Be Present

Be present with other people and with myself through active listening, active feeling, active being - especially asking clarifying questions and being slow and thoughtful before responding and making space for other people.

### Be of Service to Others

Connect with people to understand who they are, serving them and co-creating with them. Treat everyone as they truly are - whole, capable, awesome!

### Be Authentic and Vulnerable

Dare to bring the whole me to being and doing do, and dare to deeply connect with other people even if that sometimes means having difficult conversations or things getting weird. There is tremendous possibility for joy (as well as tribulation) in being authentic and vulnerable!

### Play

Keep it light; smile, joke, play! It's an important part of being a human and connecting with other people. And it's a heck of a lot of fun!
