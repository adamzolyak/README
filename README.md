## About Me

Adam Zolyak is passionate about helping people to have more meaningful work and relationships in their lives.  Adam pursues this passion as a product manager, maker, speaking, writing, and hackathons. 

## My Principles
* **Bias to action**, achieve small incremental wins, learn by doing, and iterate as needed to achieve outcomes; donâ€™t wait for perfect answers 

* **Be Intentional**, say yes to the most valuable things and no or "maybe later" to the rest. 

* **Be curious**, lead through asking questions and assume nothing to learn how to best serve others (co-workers, business, customers, people)

* **Win, Lose, and Learn Fast**, have more opportunities at bat by limit work in progress, work in small increments, minimize queues / handoffs / dependencies, get feedback and measure impact

* **Be present**, focus on others over me, actively listen, and be slow and thoughtful before responding

* **Be of service to people**, connect, collaborate, and partner with people to understand their needs and help to achieve them

* **Be authentic and vulnerable**, bring the whole me to work and dare to deeply connect with other people even if that sometimes means having difficult conversations or having strong opinions loosely held

## Working With Me

### Conditions I like to work in

* I like the right place for the right type of work.  Open spaces for connecting and collaborating with other people, quiet places for focus work.  I often go to a coffee shop, conference room, or work from home when I need to focus.  I also often wear headphones listening to white noise or wordless music when Iâ€™m focusing.  

### The times/hours I like to work

* I normally work from 8-5 pm MT, taking breaks throughout the day to recharge my energy by socially connecting with other people, walking, reading, and eating.

* I try to do learning / thinking / synthesizing work in the mornings and making / collaborating work in the afternoons.

### Best ways to communicate with me

* I check email, text messages, Slack, etc a few times per day.  I minimize push notifications.  If something is urgent, call me or find me in person.

* My calendar is up to date.  Feel free to schedule time; however, I prefer meetings as working sessions.  Most things can be communicated via notes, emails, etc; let me decide if I need more information.  Please donâ€™t schedule over an existing meeting without asking me.

### The ways I like to receive feedback

* I love learning about feedback and new options to help improve myself so that I can be of better service to myself and others.  Feedback can be hard to receive, but it's such a service to give it to someone.

* I appreciate candid and direct communication.  I prefer receiving feedback face to face so we can have a conversation about it.

* I appreciate timely feedback so that itâ€™s actionable and easier to digest vs a large batch of feedback.

* I appreciate frequent feedback.  

### Things I need

* I need to deeply understand the why behind something before I do it.

* I need time to recharge my energy so I can focus on activities that require a lot of energy and attention.

### How I learn best

* Iâ€™m a visual learner. I like drawing, pictures, and videos.

* I learn through real tactical examples and stories.  I like to live deep at least once.

* I learn by doing and through experience.  I believe learning is an iterative experiential process, so I prefer minimal planning before doing. 

### Things I struggle with

* Too many processes or activities that arenâ€™t connected with a why or arenâ€™t producing value.  Anything that isn't directly achieving a goal is waste and should only occur if it's serving the outcome.

* Too much top-down management or control; if prefer autonomy with clear goals and guardrails.
