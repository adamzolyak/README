## About Me

Adam Zolyak is passionate about helping people to have more meaningful work and relationships in their lives.  Adam pursues this passion as a product management, maker, speaking, writing, and hackathons. 

## My Principles
â€¢ **Bias to action**, achieve small incremental wins, learn by doing, and iterate as needed to achieve outcomes; donâ€™t wait for perfect answers 
â€¢ **Be curious**, lead through asking questions and assume nothing to learn how to best serve others (co-workers, business, customers, people)
â€¢ **Be present**, focus on others over myself, actively listen, and be slow and thoughtful before responding
â€¢ **Be of service to people**, connect, collaborate, and partner with people to understand their needs and help to achieve them
â€¢ **Be authentic and vulnerable**, bring the whole me to work and dare to deeply connect with other people even if that sometimes means having difficult conversations or having strong opinions loosely held
